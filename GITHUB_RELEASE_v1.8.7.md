# 🎯 v1.8.7 - Media Player Entity Naming Fix 🇺🇦

## 🔧 **Quick Fix Release**

This focused release resolves the media player entity naming issue where entities were incorrectly showing as `denon_none` instead of proper descriptive names. A small but important improvement for better user experience.

### ✨ **What's Fixed**
- 🏷️ **Media Player Naming**: Fixed entity naming from `denon_none` to proper `Media Player`
- 🎛️ **Entity Display**: Improved entity identification in Home Assistant interface
- 📝 **HA Standards**: Enhanced compliance with Home Assistant entity naming conventions
- 🌍 **Multilingual**: Fix applies across all 26 supported languages

## 🔍 **The Problem**

### ❌ **Before v1.8.7**
- Media player entity displayed as: `denon_none`
- Confusing entity identification in HA interface
- Poor user experience with unclear naming

### ✅ **After v1.8.7** 
- Media player entity displays as: `Denon Media Player` (or your device name + "Media Player")
- Clear, descriptive entity identification
- Professional, consistent naming across all languages

## 🛠️ **Technical Details**

### **Root Cause**
The media player entity had a `name` property returning `None`, which caused Home Assistant's entity naming system to generate the `_none` suffix when combined with `_attr_has_entity_name = True`.

### **Solution Applied**
- **Removed problematic `name` property** that returned `None`
- **Enhanced translation key usage** for proper entity naming
- **Leveraged HA's built-in naming system** with translation support

### **Code Changes**
```python
# REMOVED: Problematic name property
@property
def name(self):
    return None  # This caused the _none suffix

# PRESERVED: Proper translation key
@property
def translation_key(self):
    return "media_player"  # Uses translations for naming
```

## 🌍 **All Features Preserved**
