# Release Notes v1.8.6 - Critical Stability Fix 🛠️🇺🇦

## Overview
This **critical maintenance release** resolves essential integration stability issues while preserving all multilingual features from v1.8.5. Users experiencing setup errors should update immediately for stable operation.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### Problem: Duplicate Platform Setup Errors
**Symptoms:** Integration failed to start with repeated errors:
```
ValueError: Config entry Denon (ID) for denon_avr_3805.sensor has already been setup!
ValueError: Config entry Denon (ID) for denon_avr_3805.switch has already been setup!
ValueError: Config entry Denon (ID) for denon_avr_3805.media_player has already been setup!
ValueError: Config entry Denon (ID) for denon_avr_3805.binary_sensor has already been setup!
```

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Duplicate `async_step_init` methods in OptionsFlowHandler causing conflicts
2. Aggressive reload logic triggering unnecessary platform setup/teardown cycles
3. Inefficient unload logic not properly handling platform state

## Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Configuration Flow Cleanup
- **Removed duplicate `async_step_init` methods** causing method override conflicts
- **Enhanced options flow navigation** with proper step handling
- **Improved error handling and validation** in configuration steps

### 2. Intelligent Update System
- **Added `async_update_entry` function** with smart reload logic
- **Platform options changes** → Full reload (when needed)
- **Connection data changes** (IP, port, name, model) → In-place update (no reload)
- **Significant performance improvement** with reduced setup/teardown operations

### 3. Robust Lifecycle Management
- **Enhanced `async_unload_entry`** with better platform tracking
- **Defensive programming** for edge cases and state management
- **Improved resource cleanup** and memory management

## Code Changes Summary

### `/custom_components/denon_avr_3805/config_flow.py`
- Removed duplicate `async_step_init` method causing conflicts
- Clean options flow with single, proper init method

### `/custom_components/denon_avr_3805/__init__.py`
- Added intelligent `async_update_entry` function
- Enhanced `async_unload_entry` with robust platform handling  
- Optimized update listener to use smart update instead of full reload

### Version Updates
- `manifest.json`: Updated to version 1.8.6
- `const.py`: VERSION constant synchronized to 1.8.6
