# 🔄 v2.0.3 - Restored Working Integration

**Release Type:** Emergency Hotfix
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Fixes complete integration failure
**Compatibility:** Home Assistant 2023.8+

## 🚨 Emergency Revert

This emergency release **reverts all changes from v2.0.0-v2.0.2** due to critical bugs that completely broke the integration for all users. We have restored the proven stable v1.9.0 codebase.

### 🚫 Critical Issues in v2.0.0-v2.0.2 (NOW FIXED)
- **Complete Connection Failure:** Missing `_attempt_connection` method prevented all TCP connections
- **Import Errors:** `NameError: DenonAvr3805DataUpdateCoordinator is not defined`
- **Platform Loading Failures:** All entity platforms (binary_sensor, sensor, media_player, switch) failed to load
- **Circular Import Issues:** Poorly implemented type annotations caused import loops
- **Integration Completely Broken:** No functionality whatsoever for all users

## ✅ Restored Functionality

### Core Operations Back Online
- ✅ **TCP Connections Working:** Reliable connection to Denon AVR-3805 via ser2net
- ✅ **All Platforms Loading:** Media player, sensors, switches, and binary sensors operational
- ✅ **AVR Control Restored:** Power, volume, input switching, and mute controls functional
- ✅ **Coordinator Stable:** Data updates and entity state management working properly
- ✅ **No More Import Errors:** Clean module loading without circular dependencies

### User Experience Preserved
- ✅ **26 Language Support:** Complete multilingual UI with Ukrainian solidarity 🇺🇦
- ✅ **Clean Entity Names:** English entity IDs with native language labels
- ✅ **Reliable Automation:** Consistent entity references for international users
- ✅ **Real-time Updates:** Instant status changes without integration reloads

## 📦 Installation

- **Simple, Working Entity Classes:** No complex inheritance or typing issues
- **Reliable Coordinator:** Straightforward data update cycle
- **All UI Improvements:** 26-language support and clean entity naming maintained

### Lessons Learned
- **Reliability First:** Advanced features must not compromise core functionality
- **Gradual Implementation:** Complex changes should be introduced incrementally with thorough testing
- **Backward Compatibility:** New features must maintain compatibility with existing functionality
- **User Impact Assessment:** Consider the impact on users who depend on the integration daily

## 🔮 Future Plans
